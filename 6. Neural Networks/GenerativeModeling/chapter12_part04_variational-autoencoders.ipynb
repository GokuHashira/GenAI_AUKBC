    "\n",
    "Variational autoencoders, simultaneously discovered by Kingma & Welling in December 2013, and Rezende, Mohamed & Wierstra in January 2014, \n",
    "are a kind of generative model that is especially appropriate for the task of image editing via concept vectors. They are a modern take on \n",
    "autoencoders -- a type of network that aims to \"encode\" an input to a low-dimensional latent space then \"decode\" it back -- that mixes ideas \n",
    "from deep learning with Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical image autoencoder takes an image, maps it to a latent vector space via an \"encoder\" module, then decode it back to an output \n",
    "with the same dimensions as the original image, via a \"decoder\" module. It is then trained by using as target data the _same images_ as the \n",
    "input images, meaning that the autoencoder learns to reconstruct the original inputs. By imposing various constraints on the \"code\", i.e. \n",
    "the output of the encoder, one can get the autoencoder to learn more or less interesting latent representations of the data. Most \n",
    "commonly, one would constraint the code to be very low-dimensional and sparse (i.e. mostly zeros), in which case the encoder acts as a way \n",
    "to compress the input data into fewer bits of information."

    "In practice, such classical autoencoders don't lead to particularly useful or well-structured latent spaces. They're not particularly good \n",

    "\n",
    "A VAE, instead of compressing its input image into a fixed \"code\" in the latent space, turns the image into the parameters of a statistical \n",

    "process, and that the randomness of this process should be taken into accounting during encoding and decoding. The VAE then uses the mean \n",
    "and variance parameters to randomly sample one element of the distribution, and decodes that element back to the original input. The \n",
    "stochasticity of this process improves robustness and forces the latent space to encode meaningful representations everywhere, i.e. every \n",

    "In technical terms, here is how a variational autoencoder works. First, an encoder module turns the input samples `input_img` into two \n",
    "parameters in a latent space of representations, which we will note `z_mean` and `z_log_variance`. Then, we randomly sample a point `z` \n",
    "from the latent normal distribution that is assumed to generate the input image, via `z = z_mean + exp(z_log_variance) * epsilon`, where \n",
    "epsilon is a random tensor of small values. Finally, a decoder module will map this point in the latent space back to the original input \n",
    "image. Because `epsilon` is random, the process ensures that every point that is close to the latent location where we encoded `input_img` \n",
    "(`z-mean`) can be decoded to something similar to `input_img`, thus forcing the latent space to be continuously meaningful. Any two close \n",
    "points in the latent space will decode to highly similar images. Continuity, combined with the low dimensionality of the latent space, \n",
    "forces every direction in the latent space to encode a meaningful axis of variation of the data, making the latent space very structured \n",
    "and thus highly suitable to manipulation via concept vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of a VAE are trained via two loss functions: first, a reconstruction loss that forces the decoded samples to match the \n",
    "initial inputs, and a regularization loss, which helps in learning well-formed latent spaces and reducing overfitting to the training data.\n",
